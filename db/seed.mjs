        title: "Taras Shevchenko - The Bard of People\'s Freedom",
        overview: "Years and centuries pass, generations succeed one another, but great works of art remain, long surviving their creators and the message they bring is fresh in each new age. Great poets speak for their people, speak in their people's names and express their most cherished dreams, thoughts and aspirations. Taras Shevchenko was such a poet. His poetry is national and yet so international and humanistic, so distinctive and yet so universal, that it appeals and speaks for all people. Founder of the modern literary Ukrainian language, Shevchenko became the first Ukrainian poet to achieve an international reputation. Also a great artist, he was twice celebrated as a champion of people\'s freedom by UNESCO."

        title: "Who Was Marie Curie?",
        overview: "Born in Warsaw, Poland, on November 7, 1867, Marie Curie was forbidden to attend the male-only University of Warsaw, so she enrolled at the Sorbonne in Paris to study physics and mathematics. There she met a professor named Pierre Curie, and the two soon married, forming one of the most famous scientific partnerships in history. Together they discovered two elements and won a Nobel Prize in 1903. (Later Marie won another Nobel award for chemistry in 1911.) She died in Savoy, France, on July 4, 1934, a victim of many years of exposure to toxic radiation."

        title: "Who Was Stephen Hawking?",
        overview: "Stephen Hawking was born exactly three hundred years after the death of the scientist Galileo, so maybe it was written in the stars that he would become a famous scientist in his own right. Although he was diagnosed with a neurological disease at age 21, Stephen did not let the illness define his life. Known for his groundbreaking work in physics, and identified by his wheelchair and computerized voice system, Stephen continued his research until his death in 2018. He is best known for his black hole theories and his best-selling book A Brief History of Time. Stephen Hawking is an example of a person who had a great mind, but an even greater spirit."

        title: "The Forest Song: A Fairy Play",
        overview: "The Forest Song represents the crowning achievement of Lesia Ukrainka’s mature period and is a uniquely powerful poetic text. A play in three acts, it seemingly breaks with her intellectually charged social and cultural themes, which range from feminism and the deconstruction of patriarchy to the workings of colonialism, even in antiquity. Here, the author instead presents a symbolist meditation on the interaction of humanity and nature set in a world of primal forces and pure feelings as seen through childhood memories and the re-creation of local Volhynian folklore. The play unfolds in spirited dialogues between characters from Ukrainian mythology and people of the land: Old Man River, the Nymph, two water spirits, Uncle Leo, Luke, Sylph, and the peasant woman Kylyna and her mother-in-law. The Forest Song is a testament to the power of love to overcome differences and bring loved ones back from the dead."
