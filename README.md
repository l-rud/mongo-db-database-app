## Skill-based assignment creating a MongoDB database application  
     
### The application functions as a back-end (server & database) for a basic home library catalog system where books are organized by genres and authors and includes a front-end component (EJS templating engine to render views, displaying data to the client).      
  
### Description of the API's available routes and their corresponding CRUD operations:
    
**Genres:**    
    
- GET /api/genres    
- GET /api/genres/:id   
- POST /api/genres   
- PATCH /api/genres/:id    
- DELETE /api/genres/:id   

**Books:**     
    
- GET /api/books   
- GET /api/books/:id     
- POST /api/books   
- PATCH /api/books/:id   
- DELETE /api/books/:id    

**Authors:** 
          
- GET /api/authors       
- GET /api/authors/:id     
- POST /api/authors     
- PATCH /api/authors/:id    
- DELETE /api/authors/:id     
      
    
The application uses port 3000.
